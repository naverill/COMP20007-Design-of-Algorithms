                                 Jabberwocky
                                Lewis Carroll

                   'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
                     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
                   All mimst were the borogroves,
                     And the mome raths outgrabe.

                   "Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
                     The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
                   Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
                     The frumious Bandersnatch!"

                   He took his vorpal sword in hand:
                     Long time the manxome fow he sought--
                   So he rested by the Tumtum tree,
                     And stood awhile in thought.

                   And, as in uffish thought he stood,
                     The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
                   And whiffling through the tulgey wood,
                     And burbled as it came!

                   One, two!  One, two!  And through and through
                     The vorpal blade went snicker - snack!
                   He left it dead, and with its head
                     He went galumphing back.

                   And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
                     Come to my arms by beamish boy!
                   O frabious day!  Callooh!  Callay!
                     He chortled in his joy.

                   'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
                     Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
                   All mimsy were the borogroves,
                     And the mome raths outgrabe.
